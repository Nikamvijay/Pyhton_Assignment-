    "    Removing a part (Region) from an image requires the Region of interest to be provided beforehand. Where providing ROI each time the process is undergone means the ROI is hardcoded.

Where the ROI is generally a size 4 tuple which contains the top left and bottom right coordinates of the Bbox. \n",

Once the region has been identified we will turn the pixel values of that region to the ones of the background. Where background color is not constant, and hence depends upon the context for which the image is to be used. The most common backgrounds are either white or black. In this article, we will assume that the background color is black. To demonstrate this we would be removing the pixels in the region (0,0) to (100, 100) (top left side) of the aforementioned image.
